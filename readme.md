Creative_areas is a minetest mod intended to allow defined areas to be in creative mode. Due to limitations of creative mod (default minetest_game), this mod currently works with give priv.

Use /creative_area <area ID number> to add area to list of areas where creative mode is enabled.

Depends on Advanced Areas Mod by Shadow Ninja

To Do:
-Find work around to make mod work with creative priv.
-Add command to remove areas from creative area list.
-Add support to automatically check for and remove areas from creative list which are no long defined by areas mod.
